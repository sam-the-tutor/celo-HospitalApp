#### Description
This is a very simple hospital dapp where:
1. Patients who need help can be registered, so as they recieve donations.
2. Hospitals can organize fundraising for their projects.
3. Well-wishers can contribute to hospital projects
4. Well-wishers can pay for the patient's needs.
5. Only whitelisted accounts can register patients or create fundraising projects
6. A project or patient can be deleted if the owner wishes to.
7. Funded projects close automatically.
8. Patients who recieve their full donations are delisted automatically.
